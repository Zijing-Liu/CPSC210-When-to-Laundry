# When to laundry

## A scheduling application for public laundry room 

### Introduction

Get time back in your day! Students are already busy with schoolwork, so laundry should never take more time than it 
needs. The public laundry rooms at UBC residences are often fully packed at peak times.  It's not often the case to get 
laundry done on the first try, instead, students often need to check the availability multiple times until they find a 
spot. This long-standing issue has brought several concerns to most student housing residents, such as **wasted time**, 
**disrupted plans**, **mood swings caused by uncertainty**, **anxiety from falling behind schedule**, etc. In light of 
this, the application "When to laundry" will be created to host laundry bookings for UBC student residents as a digital 
solution. This application will help users determine the availability of the laundry machines and save a spot upfront. 
Users will also have the option to join the waiting list if all machines are occupied or booked in the next 24 hours. 
Users will also get notifications if a spot is vacant or if their laundry is done. Overall, this application will 
significantly help users **arrange their laundry time** and get it done more efficiently. This application will 
also help laundry managers to **track the usage of machines** and therefore determine the priority for machine 
maintenance.

User will be able to
- item 1 View the availability of all laundry machines
- item 2 Book a time slot for a laundry machine 
- item 3 View, change, cancel current booking
- item 4 Join the waiting list if all machines are booked
- item 5 View notifications sent from the system
